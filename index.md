<font size="4">
Delivering new technologies in benefit of the society is my passion.
My experience as a researcher in industry and academia has prepared me to react to the technological challenges facing the digital age. I manage a project focusing on the development of predictive models to better understand and improve a sustainable energy solution. My most recent results explain a decade-long problem about geometric constraints.
