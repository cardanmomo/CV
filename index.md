Delivering new technologies in benefit of the society is my passion.  
My experience as a researcher in industry and academia has prepared me to react to the technological challenges facing the digital age. I manage a project focusing on the development of predictive models to better understand and improve a sustainable energy solution.  
My most recent results resolve a decade-long problem about geometric constraints.
