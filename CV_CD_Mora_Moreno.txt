Delivering new energy technologies in benefit of the society is my
talent.
Passionate about the energy transition, with experience in innovative
energy carriers and converters, ranging from large research devices to
household appliances. I recognize the importance of the human factor in
technical projects and am interested in policy development, regulations,
and standardization at the European level. Aim to further develop my
skills in project management, business development, and stakeholder
engagement.
