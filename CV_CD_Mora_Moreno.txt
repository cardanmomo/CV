Delivering new technologies in benefit of the society is my passion.
My experience as a researcher in industry and academia has prepared me
to react to the technological challenges facing the digital age. I
manage a project focusing on the development of predictive models to
better understand and improve a sustainable energy solution.
My most recent results resolve a decade-long problem about geometric
constraints.
